# resume-manage-colab

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning pipeline to classify resumes into various job categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Random Forest Classifier.

## 📌 Features

- Text preprocessing and cleaning of resume data
- Stopword removal and lemmatization
- TF-IDF vectorization of textual data
- Classification using Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Colab/Jupyter)
- NLP Libraries: NLTK, re, WordCloud
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn (TF-IDF, RandomForestClassifier)
- Data Handling: pandas, NumPy

## 📂 Dataset

This notebook assumes a dataset named `resumeDataSet`, which includes:
- `Resume` column: Raw text of resumes
- `Category` column: Target labels for classification

> ⚠️ The dataset should be loaded at the start of the notebook. If not, you’ll need to upload and import it.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Make sure to upload the resume dataset.
3. Run each cell in order to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.

## 📊 Output

- Cleaned and lemmatized resume text
- TF-IDF feature matrix
- Model training and test accuracy
- Classification report showing performance across job categories

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Try deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
- Improve text preprocessing (e.g., Named Entity Recognition)
- Include resume visualization tools like WordClouds
